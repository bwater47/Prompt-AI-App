- An AI Application for anyone trying to learn about Prompt Engineering!

## Description

- This project was built to provide users with a demo to AI Prompt Engineering.
- This solves the problem of not understanding how each part of a prompt works.
- In this project, we learned the importance AI Prompt Engineering.

## Installation

You'll need to install GitBash, VS Code, Node.js, Express, Insomnia, and NPM packages which will be listed in the package.json under "Scripts". From here you will need knowledge on how to clone a repo from GitHub over to your device to store it locally. Once its stored locally on your device you can open VSCode (IDE). Lastly once VSCode is running, open the CLI (Command-Line-Interface), type npm install for the node_modules packages, and then run the server using node server.js. Once you've done this the CLI will console log the prompted question with the answer locally. You can also test this in insomnia with a post route.

## Usage

The Prompt AI Application is purely for demonstration purposes.
